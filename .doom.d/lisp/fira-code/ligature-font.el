`ligature-font-char-list'.  The arguments are the name of the
glyph and the characters to be replaced.

This predicate is evaluated once for each possible substitution
whenever `ligature-font-mode' is activated.  This predicate is
generally less useful than `ligature-font-compose-predicate', but it
is needed in situations where Fira Code provides multiple glyphs
that can be subsituted for a particular input sequence, and it
can be used to optimize screen refreshes by excluding
substitutions that are never desired in any context.

If this function returns a string, that string will be replaced
instead of the default string taken from
`ligature-font-char-list' This could be used, for example, to
replace \"*\" rather than \"x\" with the x.multiply glyph.")

replaced, plus a string containing the characters themselves.

This predicate is evaluated before each string of characters is
replaced with a glyph while `ligature-font-mode' is active.  See also
